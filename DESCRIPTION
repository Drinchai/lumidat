Title: Methods for importing Illumina gene expression iDAT
    files
Type: Package
Author: Mark Cowley
Description: This package enables the decryption, and
    preprocessing of lllumina gene expression iDAT files
    (aka version 1 iDAT files). Previously, the only option
    that Illumina gene expression customers had was to rely
    upon a miroarray core facility with access to an
    Illumina Scanner and a copy of Illumina BeadStudio, or
    GenomeStudio to pre-process the array data. Our
    intention is to allow users to pre-process their
    probe-level Illumina data using this software, thereby
    enabling them to choose from the collection of
    sophisticated normalisation and pre-processing
    procedures, which have recently been demonstrated by
    Shi et al, 2010 to simultaneously improve noise and
    bias, via the \emph{lumi}, or \emph{limma} pipelines. We
    have made every effort to reproduce the GenomeStudio
    output, down to the Detection P-Value calculation, the
    order of the rows, the background correction procedure
    (which is only applied to gene-probes), the file
    formats and names.
