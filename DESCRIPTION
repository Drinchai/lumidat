Description: This package enables the decryption, and preprocessing of
    lllumina gene expression iDAT files (aka version 1 iDAT files).
    Previously, the only option that Illumina gene expression customers
    had was to rely upon a miroarray core facility with access to an
    Illumina Scanner and a copy of Illumina BeadStudio, or GenomeStudio
    to pre-process the array data. Our intention is to allow users to
    pre-process their probe-level Illumina data using this software,
    thereby enabling them to choose from the collection of
    sophisticated normalisation and pre-processing procedures, which
    have recently been demonstrated by Shi et al, 2010 to
    simultaneously improve noise and bias, via the \eqn{lumi}, or
    \eqn{limma} pipelines. We have made every effort to reproduce the
    GenomeStudio output, down to the Detection P-Value calculation, the
    order of the rows, the background correction procedure (which is
    only applied to gene-probes), the file formats and names.
